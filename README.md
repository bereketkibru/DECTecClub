# DECTecClub
The aim of my project is to create a web app for  a college that will make the communication between club members to communicate easily and to share ideas. 
It has some features that will help students in many ways. The first feature that the web app  has is the blog post. This aims at presenting current technology news to the users. The second feature is the announcement page, this page mainly works to make the club meetings and other works to announce   for the members. There is also a chat box for the members to share their idea.
The tools that I use for the project are
NodeJs(Express)
MogoDB
EJS

If u want to use the app u can install the dependencis and write npm start
